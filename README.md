"Joyriding" w/ Ms.Joyrider360.'
Why Ms.Joyrider360 you ask? Well it started back up after 2012 (this is when the "360" was added) when Hurricane Issac hit the LaPlace area located in St. John Parish. This was the beging of one of worst times of my life!!!...But God,!!! HalleuYah!!!... He carried me through every obstacles thrown before me. On this 12yr. roller coaster called "LIFE". 

During these tramatic years, my four childern and I were homeless 12 times runing from house to house, sleeping in cars, then ultimately we had to seperate. I send them away to live w/my mom while I slept in the car, and or, at a friends house while I work until I can find another places to live, while doing all this after losing everything, 
health started, slowly deteriorating!

Praise Report Time: 
At times I've been tempoararily blind; been in a coma for a few days; has been temporarily partially paralyzed on my intire right side of my body for over 2yrs.;endured two neck and two back procedures etc., and ltes not talk about the endless hospital stays.  top of all that major health issues that caused me to have my first stroke New Year's Day 2025, while I just had relocated to Texas, and had only lived there for two days before I had the stroke, and had to relocate back to Lousiana so I could be better taken care of by family. The doctors always told me I would be dead by "40"  because of all my disorders, having two heart conditions, Sickle Cell Survior, a Lupus Survior with six mixed connective muscle and tissue disease, Tyroid disease. and I can go on and on! But GOD! When the doctors gave up on me all I had left was my "FAITH"! I prayed for healing, financial blessings, and all other needs, and He answered all of my prayers! He may not come when I want him,but He willl be there right on time when I thought  Now here I am March 2025 "JOYRIDING" I AM able to walk again w/o assistance, my speech and sight are back, I am finally getting the feelings back in my limbs from (numbness). I can hold my head upright now, when I once had no control over it for 3 days, I can feel the healing day by day, when you walk by FAITH and not by sight. I AM a living testimony, that prayers really changes things! So I had a reason to do a "360" and turn my life completely over to The Most High Yahuha / Yahusha Ha'Mashiach.

### "Joyriding" w/ "Ms.Joyrider360".
Why Ms.Joyrider360? Well, back in "2012" Hurricane Issac hit the LaPlace area located in St. John Parish. "2012" forced me to (360) during the of worst times of my life when I lost everything we owned. We had to escaped the flood waters from inside the home by emptying out large rubbermade totes, loading the kids into them so that they wouldn't drown, being cold and wet,we reached safty and was shipped to shelter to shelter! 

But God! HalleuYah! He carried me through every obstacles thrown before me on this 12yr. "ROAD-MAP called LIFE". 

During these tramatic 12 years; my four childern and I were homeless 12 times runing from house to house; went through plenty of jobs and quick hustles, sleeping in cars, along with multiple hospital stays/E.R visits, no financial assistance, no family to call on because I was the one they called on. 

REgretfully, we eventually had to seperate! I send them away to live w/my mom while I slept in the car, and or, at a friends house while I worked until I can foubd other places to live. with so much stress involved my health started, slowly deteriorating!

At times I've been tempoararily blind; been in a coma for a few days, has been temporarily partially paralyzed on the entire right side of my body for over 2yrs.. Endured two neck and two back procedures, tests, rehabatation and thearpy. All this is happening while I fighting major health issues that ultmately caused me to have my first stroke New Year's Day 2025, while I just had relocated to Texas, and had only lived there for two days before I had the stroke, and had to relocate back to Lousiana so I could be better taken care of by FAB-4. The doctors always told me I would be dead by "40"! 

False! The devil is a liar, I am almost "50" having two heart conditions, being a Sickle Cell Survior, a Lupus Survior with six mixed connective muscle and tissue disease, having Tyroid disease, and I can go on and on! But, man when them doctors gave up on me, all I had left was my "FAITH"! I prayed for healing, financial blessings etc. and He answered "ALL OF MY PRAYERS! He may not come when I want him, but He will be there right on time!

#### Udate:"March 2025" I AM "JOYRIDING" again! I AM able to walk again w/o assistance, my speech and sight are back, I am finally getting the feeling back in my limbs due to (numbness). I can hold my head upright now,( I once had no control over it for 3 days), I can feel the healing day by day, when you walk by FAITH and not by sight. I AM a living testimony, that prayers really changes things! So I had a reason to do a "360" and turn my life completely over to The Most High Yahuha / Yahusha Ha'Mashiach!
